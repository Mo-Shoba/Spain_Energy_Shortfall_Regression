<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project


The supply of electricity plays a large role in the livelihood of citizens in a country. Electricity, amongst other things, helps us stay connected, keep warm, and feed our families. Therefore there's a need to keep the lights on in order to maintain and improve the standard of living by investing in electricity infrastructure. However, in recent years, there has been evidence that the use of purely non-renewable sources is not sustainable.

The government of Spain is considering an expansion of its renewable energy resource infrastructure investments. As such, they require information on the trends and patterns of the country's renewable sources and fossil fuel energy generation. For this very reason, the government of Spain has been tracking the different energy sources available within the country.

In this project, you are tasked to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain. The daily shortfall, which will be referred to as the target variable, will be modelled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as `pressure`, `wind speed`, `humidity`, etc.
